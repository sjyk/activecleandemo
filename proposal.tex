\section{Demonstration Proposal}
In our demonstration, we will show how \sys quickly improves the accuracy of the Video Segmentation Model and the Topic Model.
We will first present a screen animation of how an analyst can use \sys with either one of these scenarios.
This will walk through all of the key panels of the interface and show real instantiations of models, gradients, and featurization.
This will serve to be an introduction to the system and will demonstrate it's performance in real scenarios.

After the animation is complete, participants will also be able to use \sys.
We will present a simplified dataset and model with artificial errors.
Participants will be able to train an SVM and clean for a binary classification task.
This will illustrate the tradeoffs and usability of the system.

In conclusion, the growing popularity of predictive ML models in data analytics adds additional challenges in managing dirty data.
Progressive data cleaning in this setting is susceptible to errors due to mixing dirty and clean data, sensitivity to sample size, and the sparsity of errors.
The key insight of \sys is that an important class of predictive models, called loss models (e.g., linear regression and SVMs), can be simultaneously trained and cleaned with guarantees.
We hope to convey to the participants that the design of the ML development environment can be used to facilitate proper methodology and convergence of algorithm.
