\subsection{The Estimator}\label{sampling}
%\subsubsection{Approximating an Oracle Sampler}
To get around the problem with oracle sampling, the estimator will estimate the cleaned value with previously cleaned data.
The estimator will also take advantage of the detector from the previous section.
There are a number of different approaches, such as regression, that could be used to estimate the cleaned value given the dirty values.
However, there is a problem of scarcity, where errors may affect a small number of records.
As a result, the regression approach would have to learn a multivariate function with only a few examples.
Thus, high-dimensional regression ill-suited for the estimator.
Conversely, it could try a very simple estimator that just calculates an average change and adds this change to all of the gradients.
This estimator can be highly inaccurate as it also applies the change to records that are known to be clean.

\sys leverages the detector for an estimator between these two extremes.
The estimator calculates average changes feature-by-feature and selectively corrects the gradient when a feature is known to be corrupted based on the detector.
It also applies a linearization that leads to improved estimates when the sample size is small.
We evaluate the linearization in Section \ref{est} against alternatives, and find that it provides more accurate estimates for a small number of samples cleaned.
The result is a biased estimator, and when the number of cleaned samples is large the alternative techniques are comparable or even slightly better due to the bias.

\paragraph{Estimation For A Priori Detection}
If most of the features are correct, it would seem like the gradient is only
incorrect in one or two of its components.
The problem is that the gradient $\nabla\phi(\cdot)$ can be a very non-linear function of the features that couple features together.
For example, the gradient for linear regression is:
\[
\nabla\phi(x,y,\theta) = (\theta^Tx - y)x
\]
It is not possible to isolate the effect of a change of one feature on the gradient.
Even if one of the features is corrupted, all of the gradient components will be incorrect.

To address this problem, the gradient can be approximated in a way that the effects of dirty features on the gradient are decoupled.
Recall, in the \emph{a priori} detection problem, that associated with each $r \in R_{dirty}$ is a set of errors $f_r,l_r$ which is a set that identifies a set of corrupted features and labels.
This property can be used to construct a coarse estimate of the clean value.
The main idea is to calculate average changes for each feature, then given an uncleaned (but dirty) record, add these average changes to correct the gradient.

To formalize the intuition, instead of computing the actual gradient with respect to the 
true clean values, compute the conditional expectation given that a set of features and labels $f_r,l_r$ are corrupted:
\[
p_i \propto \mathbb{E}(\nabla\phi(x^{(c)}_i,y^{(c)}_i,\theta^{(t)}) \mid f_r,l_r)
\]
Corrupted features are defined as that:
\[
i \notin f_r \implies x^{(c)}[i] - x^{(d)}[i] = 0
\]
\[
i \notin l_r \implies y^{(c)}[i] - y^{(d)}[i] = 0
\]

The needed approximation represents a linearization of the errors, and the resulting approximation will be of the form:
\[
p(r)\propto\|\nabla\phi(x,y,\theta^{(t)}) + M_x \cdot \Delta_{rx} +  M_y \cdot \Delta_{ry}\|
\]
where $M_x$, $M_y$ are matrices and $\Delta_{rx}$ and $\Delta_{ry}$ are vectors with one component for each feature and label where each value is the average change for those features that are corrupted and 0 otherwise.
Essentially, it the gradient with respect to the dirty data plus some linear correction factor.
In the appendix, we present a derivation using a Taylor series expansion and a number of $M_x$ and $M_y$ matrices for common convex losses (Appendix \ref{apptaylor} and \ref{example-deriv}).
The appendix also describes how to maintain $\Delta_{rx}$ and $\Delta_{ry}$ as cleaning progresses.

\paragraph{More Accurate Early Error Estimates}\label{acc}
Linearization over avoids amplifying estimation error.
Consider the linear regression gradient:
\[
\nabla\phi(x,y,\theta) = (\theta^Tx - y)x
\]
This can be rewritten as a vector in each component:
\[
g[i] = \sum_{i} x[i]^2-x[i]y + \sum_{j \ne i} \theta[j]x[j]
\]
This function is already mostly linear in $x$ except for the one quadratic term.
However, this one quadratic term has potential to amplify errors.
Consider two expressions:
\[
f(x+\epsilon) = (x+\epsilon)^2 = x^2 + 2x\epsilon + \epsilon^2
\]
\[
f(x+\epsilon) \approx f(x) + f'(x)(\epsilon) = x^2 + 2x\epsilon
\]
The only difference between the two estimates is the quadratic $\epsilon^2$, if $\epsilon$ is highly uncertain random variable then the quadratic dominates.
If the variance is large, the Taylor estimate avoids amplifying the error.
Of course, there is a tradeoff of some additional bias since the true function is non-linear.
We evaluate this linearization in Section \ref{est} against alternatives, and find that indeed it provides more accurate estimates for a small number of samples cleaned.
When the number of cleaned samples is large the alternative techniques are comparable or even slightly better.

\paragraph{Estimation For Adaptive Case}
A similar procedure holds in the adaptive setting, however, it requires reformulation.
Here, \sys uses $u$ corruption classes provided by the detector.
Instead of conditioning on the features that are corrupted, the estimator conditions on the classes.
So for each error class, it computes a $\Delta_{ux}$ and $\Delta_{uy}$.
These are the average change in the features given that class and the average change in labels given that class.
\[
p(r_u)\propto\|\nabla\phi(x,y,\theta^{(t)}) + M_x \cdot \Delta_{ux} +  M_y \cdot \Delta_{uy}\|
\] 

\subsubsection{Example}
Here is an example of using the optimization to select a sample of data for cleaning.
\begin{example}\label{estex}
Consider using \sys with an a priori detector.
Let us assume that there are no errors in the labels and only errors in the features.
Then, each training example will have a set of corrupted features (e.g., $\{1,2,6\}$, $\{1,2,15\}$).
Suppose that the cleaner has just cleaned the records $r_1$ and $r_2$ represented as tuples with their corrupted feature set: ($r_1$,$\{1,2,3\}$), ($r_2$,$\{1,2,6\}$).
For each feature $i$, \sys maintains the average change between dirty and clean in a value in a vector $\Delta_x[i]$ for those records corrupted on that feature. 

Then, given a new record ($r_3$,$\{1,2,3,6\}$), $\Delta_{r_3x}$ is the vector $\Delta_x$ where component $i$ is set to 0 if the feature is not corrupted.
Suppose the data analyst is using an SVM, then the $M_x$ matrix is as follows:
\[
M_x[i,i] = \begin{cases}      
-y[i] \text{ if } y\cdot\boldsymbol{x}\cdot\theta \le 1 \\
0\ \text{ if } y\ \boldsymbol{x}\cdot\theta \geq 1      
\end{cases} 
\]
Thus, we calculate a sampling weight for record $r_3$:
\[
p(r_3) \propto\|\nabla\phi(x,y,\theta^{(t)}) + M_x \cdot \Delta_{r_3x} \|
\] 
To turn the result into a probability distribution, \sys normalizes over all dirty records.
\end{example}
