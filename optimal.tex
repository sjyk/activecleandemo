\section{Optimizations}\label{opti}


In this section, we describe two approaches to optimization, the {\it Detector} and the {\it Estimator}, that
improve the efficiency of the cleaning process.  
Both approaches are designed to increase the likelihood that the 
{\it Sampler} will pick dirty records that, once cleaned,
most move the model towards the true clean model.
The {\it Detector} is intended to learn the characteristics that distinguish dirty records from clean records
while the {\it Estimator} is designed to estimate the amount that cleaning a given dirty record will move the 
model towards the true optimal model.
